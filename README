NAME
    Capture::Tiny - Capture STDOUT and STDERR from Perl, XS or external
    programs

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.03.

SYNOPSIS
         use Capture::Tiny qw/capture tee/;
     
     ($stdout, $stderr) = capture {
           # your code here
         };
     
     ($stdout, $stderr) = tee {
           # your code here 
         };

DESCRIPTION
    Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture anything sent
    to STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl, from XS
    code or from an external program. Optionally, output can be teed so that
    it is captured while being passed through to the original handles. Yes,
    it even works on Windows. Stop guessing which of a dozen capturing
    modules to use in any particular situation and just use this one.

    This module was heavily inspired by IO::CaptureOutput, which provides
    similar functionality without the ability to tee output and with more
    complicated code and API.

USAGE
    The following functions are available. None are exported by default.

  capture
       ($stdout, $stderr) = capture \&code;
       $stdout = capture \&code;

    The "capture" function takes a code reference and returns what is sent
    to STDOUT and STDERR. In scalar context, it returns only STDOUT. If no
    output was received, returns an empty string. Regardless of context, all
    output is captured -- nothing is passed to the existing handles.

    It is prototyped to take a subroutine reference as an argument. Thus, it
    can be called in block form:

       ($stdout, $stderr) = capture {
         # your code here ...
       };

  tee
       ($stdout, $stderr) = tee \&code;
       $stdout = tee \&code;

    The "tee" function works just like "capture", except that output is
    captured as well as passed on to the original STDOUT and STDERR. As with
    "capture" it may be called in block form.

LIMITATIONS
    Portability is a goal, not a guarantee. "tee" requires fork, except on
    Windows where "system(1, @cmd)" is used instead. Not tested on any
    esoteric platforms yet. Minimal test suite so far.

    No support for merging STDERR with STDOUT. This may be added in the
    future.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker. Bugs
    can be submitted through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Capture-Tiny>

    When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch
    to an existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

SEE ALSO
    This is a selection of CPAN modules that provide some sort of output
    capture, albeit with various limitations that make them appropriate only
    in particular circumstances. I'm probably missing some. The long list is
    provided to show why I felt Capture::Tiny was necessary.
